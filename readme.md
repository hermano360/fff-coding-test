# Hello

I am submitting this repo for the code challenge from FabFitFun

The idea of this project is to provide a beautiful About Us interface that is able to
leverage CSS transitions to give users a unique approach to meeting the team.

I have a total of 36 sample people in the application with their own unique profile,
simulating a database of employees and their IDs.

The idea is that you click on one of the thumbnail pictures at the bottom and it blows up
to the location of the the profile card, for which each slides to the right after a new
picture has been clicked.

The optimal screen width is about 500px to about 900px. The app works beyond those media query points,
but at the cost of some aesthetics and user experience.

In order to run this application, clone the repository and type in

npm install

&&

node server.js

See localhost:3000 to view the application.
